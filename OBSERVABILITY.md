# ðŸ“ˆ OBSERVABILITY - Production Monitoring Implementation Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **What You're Building**
**Comprehensive observability** with metrics, traces, and logs to prove the system works as intended for auditors and compliance officers.

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Claude Commands for This Worktree**

### **Step 1: Start Development Session**
```bash
cd ../regops-worktrees/observability
claude  # Start interactive Claude session in observability worktree
```

### **Step 2: Tell Claude What to Build**
```
Please implement comprehensive observability for the Belgian RegOps Platform.

Create:
1. Business metrics: parallel.calls, digest.tierA.count, clock.deadline.miss, ledger.verify.ok
2. Security metrics: pii.violations=0, budget.utilization, circuit.breaker.state  
3. Performance SLOs: PII detection <50ms, Cost checking <10ms, OneGate export <30min
4. Dashboards: business_overview.json, performance_slos.json, security_monitoring.json
5. Alerting: Budget >95%, PII violations, deadline misses
6. OpenTelemetry integration for traces and spans

Add metrics collection points to all existing modules without breaking functionality.

Follow the PLAN â†’ IMPLEMENT â†’ TEST â†’ VERIFY â†’ REPORT workflow.
```

## âœ… **Success Criteria**
- [ ] All business metrics instrumented and collecting
- [ ] Security alerts fire on violations (PII, budget, deadlines)  
- [ ] Performance SLOs tracked and alerting
- [ ] Dashboards show real-time compliance status
- [ ] Auditors can prove system working as intended
